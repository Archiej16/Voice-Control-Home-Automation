# Voice-Control-Home-Automation
This project lets you control your home appliances using voice commands via a smartphone! Built using an Arduino UNO and HC-05 Bluetooth module, it processes voice inputs through a mobile app, which sends commands to the Arduino to switch devices on or off. A simple step toward a smarter, hands-free lifestyle powered by hardware and code.
